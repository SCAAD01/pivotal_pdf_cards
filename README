This is an already existing project. It converts pivotal tracker exports (.csv) into PDF files    
I have modified the printing a bit to get the attributes I need onto the cards and to stop page overflows in a bit stupid way
And I want to get familar with git hub   

This is the original project: https://gist.github.com/1137656
